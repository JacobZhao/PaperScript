\begin{abstract}
Power generation efficiency of Photovoltaic (PV) arrays is significantly affected by partial shading and PV cell damage. Partial shading or PV cell damage induces mismatched power generation among PV panels and causes the efficiency loss of power generation. Power generation of mismatched PV arrays can be recovered by reconfiguring connection of PV panels. Recently, an efficient and effective reconfiguration method is proposed where it first select candidates of configurations with approximation and then find the best one with precise power simulation. However, we found that some of  configuration candidates are not be able to realized and the method does not show any systematic way to identify such a feasibility. In this paper, we propose a very fast algorithm to check feasibility that a given configuration candidate can be actually formed by given PV panels. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method very rapidly check the feasibility with very small error rate \textcolor{blue}{(this part will be written with actual values)}.

\section{Introduction}
As fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution become more serious, green and renewable energy have become necessary for a sustainable society and environment. Photovoltaic (PV) systems receive significant attention since the sun has unlimited energy and PV arrays can be easily scaled up. However, due to the nature of a PV cell which is a basic component of a PV array, PV arrays are sensitive to partial shading and PV cell damage. PV cells could not uniformly generate power when PV cells experience different irradiances or some of cells have physical defects, and such a mismatched condition might accelerate heating and aging of PV cells and cause further damaging. To prevent PV cells from damaging, bypass diodes are usually placed in PV arrays and they are turned on in mismatched conditions. However, it causes a significant loss of power generation. 

PV arrays are hierarchically constructed such that a group of PV cells form a PV module, a group of PV modules form a PV panel, and a group of PV panels form a PV array. Power generation of mismatched PV arrays can be recovered by reconfiguring connection of these components. 
Fig.\ref{compare} shows an example of power generations of a PV array with a partial shading before and after reconfiguration. The current is improved in a middle range of control voltage (20V - 30V), and then the maximum power is improved. 

Though several reconfiguration method have been proposed, most works consider reconfiguraion in PV cell level \cite{nguyen2008adaptive,wang2014architecture,storey2013improved,storey2014optimized}. 
However, cell level reconfiguration requires a significantly high computation time and a large number of switches for reconfiguration. In addition, they require a special PV panels with capability of switching, and cannot be applied the system constructed with standard PV panels. From a practical view, reconfiguration of connection among PV panels is a realistic solution since a PV panel is manufactured as a physical one panel with two terminals and PV paneles can be flexibly interconnected.

\end{figure}


Recently, an efficient and effective reconfiguration method\cite{orozco2016optimized} is proposed where it first select candidates of configurations with approximation and then find the best one with precise power simulation. However, the candidates are specified in a PV module level though PV modules could not be fully reconfigured. Actually, we found that some of configuration candidates are not be able to realized. However, the paper\cite{orozco2016optimized}  does not show any systematic way to identify such a feasibility. 

In this paper, we propose a very fast algorithm to check feasibility that a given configuration candidate is actually formed by given PV panels. The proposed method can efficiently check the feasibility while identifying most feasible cases accurately. The experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method where ...

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{Sec2} introduces a PV array which is a targeting PV system in this paper. Section \ref{Sec3} gives related works. Section \ref{Sec4} defines a feasibility, and Sections \ref{Sec5} and \ref{Sec6} give the details of algorithm and evaluation. Section \ref{Sec7} shows the experimental results. Conclusions are provided in the last section.

\section{Photovoltaic array}\label{Sec2}
A PV system or PV array is composed of PV panels that have two terminals of plus and minus and can be interconnected. There are two common connection styles for PV arrays, \textit{series-parallel} array and \textit{total-cross-tied} array. 
In a series-parallel array, PV panels are connected in series, and multiple series connections are connected in parallel. While in a total-cross-tied array, parallel connections of PV panels are connected in series. In this paper, we focus on series-parallel arrays, since the basic idea of the proposed method can be applied also to total-cross-tied arrays. Hereafter, we simply call a series-parallel array a \textit{PV array}. 

Figure \ref{model} shows an example of a PV array. A PV array is a parallel connection of (PV) strings where a string is a series connection of PV panels. PV panel is a series connection of PV modules, and a PV module is a parallel connection of a series of PV cells and a bypass diode. A typical PV panel is composed of three PV modules each of which has 12-24 PV cells. A PV module can generate power for a given voltage according to its I-V characteristics as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:IV}(a). The I-V characteristics is affected by irradiance level and physical damage of PV cells. Figure \ref{fig:IV}(a) also shows a typical degradation of a I-V characteristics where generated current is reduced with some ratio while keeping the voltage range. When a PV panel has a partial shade, that is its PV modules have different irradiance levels and hence different I-V characteristics, the PV panels might have multiple peaks (maximum power points, MPPs) in power generation as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:IV}(b). 

To find out an accurate I-V characteristics of PV panel, we need a time consuming power simulation. However, we can roughly understand a I-V characteristics of a PV panel (and also a string) as follows. When a control voltage is low, PV modules with high irradiance level are active while PV modules with low irradiance level are inactive with turning on their bypass diodes. In this case, a high current can flow in the PV panel. When control voltage is high, some of bypass diodes become turning off and the corresponding PV modules become active. In this case, the current level is reduced and generated power sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. The generated power at MPPs can be roughly estimated. In Fig.\ref{fig:IV}(b), one PV panel has three PV modules with different irradiance levels. The peak currents for these modules are 5A, 3A, and 1.5A, respectively. Voltages at MPPs are roughly 20V, 40V, 60V in Fig.\ref{fig:IV}(b), those are roughly multiples of a voltage of MPP for one PV module (around 20V in this case). At the first MPP (MPP1), only one PV module with a peak current of 5A is active at a control voltage of 20A, so the generated power is 100W. At the second MPP (MPP2), two PV modules with peak currents of 5A and 3A are active at a control voltage of 40A. In this case, the current level of the PV panel is 3A since two PV panels are connected in series and they have to have the same current level, and the generated power is 120W. At the third MPP (MPP3), the current level of the PV panel is 1.5A at a control voltage of 60A, and the generated power is 90W. 

In a PV arary, we have two constraints. PV panels in the same string have the same current level, while all the strings have the same control voltage. When considering reconfiguration of PV panel connection, we should find out the best configuration while considering these constraints.

%In this paper we use the following model of PV array, module, string and panel as showed in Fig.\ref{model}. In general, a PV array is a combination of multiple PV panels. Several series-connected PV panels in formed of a string. And several parallel connected string in formed of PV array. This is typical S-P network PV array. A PV panel usually formed by three series-connected PV module which in formed of several series-connected PV cells. For each PV module a bypass diode is connected in parallel for reversing the reverse current. PV cells in a PV panel may have different conditions (irradiance or fault) and hence have different  upper limits for their generated currents. Therefore, as shown in Fig.\ref{one_panel} for lower control voltage, only PV cells can generate high currents be able to work and other PV cells don't generate current with their bypass diode turned on. Fig.\ref{ser-par} show I-V character for two series and parallel connected PV panels. The series-connection structure accepts a wider range of control voltage and parallel-connection structure can generate higher current.


%When understanding the I-V characteristics of different structure of PV panels, by using the algorithm in \cite{carotenuto2014online} we can find the I-V curves of panels and (near) MPPs, short circuit current, open circuit voltage of each panel in mismatch condition. These values form a fingerprint of connection.

\section{Related works}\label{Sec3}

Some of methods that reconfigure connection of PV panels are proposed. A PV array reconfiguration using genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in \cite{carotenuto2015evolutionary}. Though it can give a new configuration, but computing cost is significantly high and the algorithm cannot generate the best configuration precisely.  
%The work in \cite{malathy2017reconfiguration} employed Irradiation equivalence method by using swathing matrix relocate PV panels. 
%This is a review paper!
%At PV module level, paper \cite{wang2014architecture} proposed a dynamic programming algorithm to adaptively produce near-optimal reconfiguration, the work in \cite{storey2014optimized} proposed a method for dynamic reconfigure PV array based on string-configured topology.
%To give the reconfiguration more expeditiously, the mathematical searching algorithm needs to be developed instead of sample exhaustive searching algorithm. Reference \cite{faldella1991architectural} given a method based on the tabular searching algorithm, it performing well on small size PV array, but it is hard to apply on a large scale array. 
An algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to find switch matrix topology is proposed \cite{iraji2017optimisation}. 

%But the reference \cite{carotenuto2015evolutionary} -\cite{iraji2017optimisation} given reconfiguration methods either force on uniformly distributed shadow or using GA and exhaustive searching algorithm. 

An efficient and effective reconfiguration method is proposed where it first select candidates of configurations with approximation and then find the best one with precise power simulation \cite{orozco2016optimized}. 
%The paper \cite{orozco2016optimized} proposes an efficient and effective reconfiguration algorithm where by using approximated values of MPP current and voltage to generate configuration candidates. 
In this method,%%% 


first list and calculate configuration candidates by a fast estimation method in \cite{orozco2015fast}, and for each candidate, precise power simulation are applied. However, when the size of PV array are extremely large, it's impossible to do power simulation for each configuration candidate, and some configuration candidates might not be feasible, this is, it is impossible to realize a configuration designed by given PV panels.

%In this paper, we propose an algorithm to identify feasibility based on the configuration candidates from \cite{orozco2016optimized} and a new connection topology to increase system flexibility without loss too much accuracy. 
% By reconfigure electrical connection of mismatched PV array can increase power generation efficiency. 

Orozco-Guierrez et al. proposed a fast reconfiguration algorithm for mismatched PV arrays \cite{orozco2016optimized}, where the online monitoring \cite{carotenuto2014online} and power estimation \cite{orozco2015fast} are utilized. For the method in \cite{orozco2016optimized}, first, close values will be approximated and then possible combinations of reconfiguration are enumerated. For each configuration candidates their generate power value are estimated by \cite{orozco2015fast} along with careful estimation of possible errors. This method provided a simplified feasibility check, for all possible configuration the representative value with some error rate \textit{err}. Select configuration candidates with \textit{err} from the largest estimation value.

This method has given configuration candidates designate the number of strings, current value of each string and the number of modules which not been bypassed of each string. Besides, the number of active modules are common for each string based on that each PV string are connected in parallel. However, for some configuration candidates, we may not be able to find such combination that fit the requirement. We find out the simple feasibility check based on the number of active PV modules for each representative current values in \cite{orozco2016optimized} is optimistic and does not always identify the infeasible case.

\section{Feasibility}\label{Sec4}
To execute a power simulation for a PV array. We need to assign panels into different location to realize the candidate configuration. The definition of feasibility is in Equation \ref{feasibility}. When the number of working modules in a string ($M_S$) are less than the number of working module per-string ($Q_M$), this configuration is infeasible.
\begin{equation}
    \left\{\begin{matrix}
        M_S < Q_{M} & & \text{Infeasible}\\ 
        M_S \geqslant Q_{M} & & \text{Feasible} 
    \end{matrix}\right.
    \label{feasibility}
\end{equation}

For example, An 3X3 PV array formed by 9 PV panels. The number of modules that are able to work at current value for each string as showed in Table \ref{not_feasible}.The dot in each block in form of a PV module. As the number of modules and the panel they belong to, it is straight forward that panel P1 for any current value it have at least 2 modules can work. Instead of panel P9 only have 1 module can work at 0.5A.
One configuration requires 6 modules working for each string at 0.5A, 0.5A and 3A($Q_M = 6$). According to Table \ref{not_feasible} there isn't any combination for such configuration. Of course we can compute it by using exhaustive searching. However it is time-consuming. So we need an algorithm to efficiently identify feasibility for each configuration candidates.

\section{An algorithm to identify feasibility}\label{Sec5}
In this section we proposed an algorithm to identify feasibility.
\subsection{Input And Output Of Algorithm}\label{Sec5_1}
The input of algorithm is the information of PV array and Configuration candidates. The information of PV array contains a set of panels and the number of working modules in each panel for each current values. Table \ref{Info_Array} shows the information of a PV panel from Table \ref{not_feasible} for configuration \{0.5A, 0.5A, 3A, $Q_M = 6$ \}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Information of PV Array}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
    \hline\hline
             & P1 & P2  & P3  & P4 & P5 & P6  & P7  & P8  & P9  \\ \hline
         String1-0.5A & 3& 3 & 1   & 1  & 3& 2  & 1   & 3 & 1 \\ \hline
         String2-0.5A & 3& 3 & 1   & 1  & 3& 2  & 1   & 3 & 1  \\ \hline
         String3-3A   & 2 & 2  & 1   & 1  & 2 & 0  &0   &0  &0  \\\hline \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{Info_Array}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
It terms that for panel P2, 3 modules are able to work on String1 or String2 and 2 modules are able to work on String3. Due to one panel can only connected to single string. So the output of algorithm is the feasibility answer for a configuration. That is, the algorithm determines whether there exists an assignment of panels to strings that realizes the configuration required.

\subsection{Algorithm}

Let the $S$ for the number of PV strings and $P$ be the number of PV panels, $M_{(i,p)}$ is the number of modules on panel $p$ at current value $i$. For each panel we consider the different vector $Loss[p,k] = M_{(i_{k-1},p)}-M_{(i_{k},p)} ,(k \leq S)$. This vector means if we use panel $p$ on current $k$  it will loss $Loss[p,k]$ working modules in current $k-1$. Without loss of generality, for each panel $p$, $Loss^*[p] = ( Loss[p,k_1], Loss[p,k_2],..., Loss[p,k_S] )$ and $Loss^*[p_i] \leq Loss^*[p_j]$ holds for any $i \leq j$. After sorting all panels in lexicographic order by vector $Loss^*[p]$, we will have a order for arranging panels in different location.

To assign panels in right location, following steps are required.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Selecting panel from sorted panels until selected contain enough PV modules working at the highest desired current value.
\item Remove selected panels which don't have PV modules working at the highest desired current value for further more selection.
\item In selected panels, try to find a combination that provided exact number of modules working at the highest desired current value.\label{find_exact}
\item Swap selected panels to find a combination with minimum number of panels. This SWAP will follow several priorities.\label{swap}
\item If SWAP approved, step \ref{swap} will be repeated till number of panels are minimized.
\item Otherwise, none of SWAP will be approved. Evaluate selected panels with feasibility requirement in \ref{Sec4} equation (\ref{feasibility}).
\item If there remain any un-selected panel, as them to different PV strings that balance the string length.
\end{enumerate}

We explain step (\ref{find_exact}) and (\ref{swap}) that finding a local optimized combination of a desired current value. To do this, we begin with sorting panels by vector $Loss^*[p]$. That will let a panel with minimum module losses be the first one in a string with highest current value. When $Loss^*[p_a] = Loss^*[p_b]$ which means panel $a$ and panel $b$'s module losses are same and they are in same loss level ($LV$). By using vector $LV$ we can divide selected panels into different groups.

To get exact number of working modules, we start to search panels form last loss level to first loss level. In each $LV$ remove the panel $x$ which $M_{(j,x)} \leq Q_M - \sum (M_{(j,\textup{Selected Panels})})$. This step will cut the number of panels and increase flexibility.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{SWAP Example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc|cc}\hline \hline
                               & \multicolumn{5}{c|}{Selected Panels} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Swap Panels} \\
                               & $P1$    & $P2$   & $P3$    & $P4$    & $P5$   & $P6$            & $P7$             \\ \hline
High                           & 1     & 1     & 1     & 1     & 2    & 2              & 2              \\ \hline
Low                            & 1     & 1     & 1     & 2     & 3    & 3              & 3              \\ \hline
$Loss^*[p]$ & 0     & 0     & 0     & 1     & 1    & 1              & 1             
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table_swap}
\end{table}

For swapping panels, panels with same $LV$ as selected panels can be swapped. In order to not loss flexibility, swapped panles' $Loss^*[p]$ should less than unswap panels'. For example as Table \ref{table_swap}, panel $P1-P5$ are selected panels. Panel $P6$ and $P7$ have the same $Loss^*[p]$ vector as $P5$, so they are able to swap. Due to $P1$ and $P2$'s $Loss^*[p]$ are less than $P6$'s, we can not swap them. On the other hand, we can swap panel $P1$ and $P4$ with $P6$. Keeping the same module losses and further reduce the number of panels.  Pseudo codes are given below to give details to summarize the process of proposed algorithm.

\subsection{Evaluation}
Although the pilot example refers to three strings only, the extension of the method to any number of parallel connected strings is the same.

To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, we compare the result with exhaustive searching algorithm for 300 random shadow distributed PV array. For each PV array, contains {\color{red} \textbf{how many - how many}} PV panels connected into {\color{red} \textbf{how many - how many}} PV strings. For each PV panels, it will have {\color{red}{how many - how many}} working current value.

The computational time required for finding optimal configuration and accuracy of feasibility judgment in the proposed algorithm and exhaustive search algorithm are compared in Table \ref{result_compare}. As shown in Table \ref{result_compare}, proposed algorithm achieved less computing time compare with exhaustive search algorithm and with high accuracy.  
\section{Simulation}\label{Sec6}
In this section, we consider using 3 different size PV array, which are 3 $\times$ 4 array, 60 $\times$ 4 array and 40 $\times$ 15 array. The whole process though SPICE simulation with the configuration result by proposed algorithm. The PV cell's parameters are shown in Table \ref{PV_cell_par}.

\subsection{3 $\times$ 4 Array}
In a 3 $\times$ 4 array, there are 12 panels connected in parallel for 4 strings, for each string contains 3 PV panels. The shadow conditions for PV array are not uniformly, as shown in Fig. \ref{shadow_3x4_a}. Without reconfiguration, PV array output I-V characteristic as shown in Fig. \ref{shadow_3x4_b}. The global MPP as {\color{red}{how many Watt}} on {\color{red}{how many voltage}}. After proposed algorithm based reconfiguration, this PV array achieved {\color{red}{how many Watt}} on {\color{red}{how many voltage}} for global MPP. The output power has increased by {\color{red}{how many \%}}
\subsection{60 $\times$ 4 Array}
For medium size 60 $\times$ 4 array, on standard test condition the power output are {\color{red}{how many KW}} without any shadow. Fig. \ref{shadow_60x4_a} presents the shadow distribution amount the PV array which power output are {\color{red}{how may KW}}. After reconfiguration, panel arrangement as illustrated in Fig. \ref{shadow_60x4_b}. With reconfiguration, power generation increased by {\color{red}{how many \%}}.
\subsection{40 $\times$ 15 Array}
As a large scale PV array. Although the algorithm proposed in \cite{orozco2016optimized} are hard to converge when the configuration candidates are widely distributed. The algorithm we proposed still calculate the feasible configuration result very fast. {\color{red}{60}} configuration candidates though the feasibility judgment algorithm in 269.6s with {\color{red}{20}} feasible configuration as shown in Table \ref{shadow_40x15_table}.
