abstract = {In the presence of partial shading and other mismatch factors, bypass diodes may not offer complete elimination of excessive power dissipation due to cell reverse biasing, commonly referred to as hot-spotting in photovoltaic (PV) systems. As a result, PV systems may experience higher failure rates and accelerated ageing. In this paper, a cell-level simulation model is used to assess occurrence of hot-spotting events in a representative residential rooftop system scenario featuring a moderate shading environment. The approach is further used to examine how well distributed power electronics converters mitigate the effects of partial shading and other sources of mismatch by preventing activation of bypass diodes and thereby reducing the chances of heavy power dissipation and hot-spotting in mismatched cells. The simulation results confirm that the occurrence of heavy power dissipation is reduced in all distributed power electronics architectures, and that submodule-level converters offer nearly 100{\%} mitigation of hot-spotting. In addition, the paper further elaborates on the possibility of hot-spot-induced permanent damage, predicting a lifetime energy loss above 15{\%}. This energy loss is fully recoverable with submodule-level power converters that mitigate hot-spotting and prevent the damage.},

abstract = {The contribution of renewable energy to the field of energy markets has been substantial over the last few years. A large number of PV array installations show the increasing contribution of solar energy to the renewable energy. Partial shading of the PV arrays is one of the most discussed and worked upon concept for the simple reasons that it decreases the power output of the PV array installations and exhibits multiple peaks in the I-V characteristics. As a result, the modules have to be reconfigured to get the maximum power output. This papers presents an optimization based approach for Total cross tied (TCT) connected modules in a PV array. The physical locations of the modules remain unchanged while the electrical connections are altered. The genetic algorithm (GA) as an optimization tool, gives the connection matrix for the new electrical interconnection which fetches the maximum power output from the PV array. This is done to obtain uniform dispersion of shadow throughout the panel.},

@article{Waag2013,
abstract = {The online estimation of battery states and parameters is one of the challenging tasks when battery is used as a part of the pure electric or hybrid energy system. For the determination of the available energy stored in the battery, the knowledge of the present state-of-charge (SOC) and capacity of the battery is required. For SOC and capacity determination often the estimation of the battery electromotive force (EMF) is employed. The electromotive force can be measured as an open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery when a significant time has elapsed since the current interruption. This time may take up to some hours for lithium-ion batteries and is needed to eliminate the influence of the diffusion overvoltages. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate the EMF by considering the OCV relaxation process within only some first minutes after the current interruption. The approach is based on an online fitting of an OCV relaxation model to the measured OCV relaxation curve. This model is based on an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source (represents the EMF) in series with the parallel connection of the resistance and a constant phase element (CPE). Based on this fitting the model parameters are determined and the EMF is estimated. The application of this method is exemplarily demonstrated for the state-of-charge and capacity estimation of the lithium-ion battery in an electrical vehicle. In the presented example the battery capacity is determined with the maximal inaccuracy of 2{\%} using the EMF estimated at two different levels of state-of-charge. The real-time capability of the proposed algorithm is proven by its implementation on a low-cost 16-bit microcontroller (Infineon XC2287). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The NiH2 battery model begins with a given continuous-function electrochemical math model. The math model for the battery consists of the sum of two electrochemical process DC currents, which are a function of the battery terminal voltage. This paper describes procedures for realizing a voltage-source SPICE model which implements the electrochemical equations using behavioral sources. The model merges the essentially DC non-linear behavior of the electrochemical model, together with the empirical AC dynamic terminal impedance from measured data. Thus the model integrates the short-term linear impedance behavior, with the long-term nonlinear DC resistance behavior. The long-duration non-Faradaic capacitive behavior of the battery is represented by a time constant. Outputs of the model include battery voltage/current, state-of-charge, and charge-current efficiency.},

Mobile systems spend most of their operating time in very low power modes, in which the voltage regulators (VRs) that feed the different components typically exhibit low efficiencies. Variable frequency control is one of the most commonly used methods to minimize both driving and switching losses by scaling the switching frequency at light loads. However, further benefit can be achieved if the input voltage scales as well. This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable battery pack (RBP) concept to improve power conversion efficiency of VRs under light load conditions. It describes a methodology to change the input voltage of VRs based on load conditions by changing the internal connection of battery cells to provide a variable input bus voltage to the system and extend battery life as a result of power loss reduction.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that a partially solar powered EV can significantly save battery energy during cruising using innovative fast photovoltaic array (PV) reconfiguration. Use of all the vehicle surface areas, such as the hood, rooftop, door panels, quarter panels, etc., makes it possible to install more PV modules, but it also results in severe performance degradation due to inherent partial shading. This paper introduces fast online PV array reconfiguration and customization of the PV array installation according to the driving pattern and overcomes the partial shading phenomenon. We implement a high-speed, high-voltage PV reconfiguration switch network with IGBTs (insulated-gate bipolar transistors) and a controller. We derive the optimal reconfiguration period based on the solar irradiance/driving profiles using adaptive learning method, where the on/off delay of IGBT, CAN (control area network) delay, computation overhead, and energy overhead are taken into account. Experimental results show 25{\%} more power generation from the PV array. This paper also introduces two important design-time optimization problems to achieve trade-off between performance and overhead. We derive the optimal PV reconfiguration granularity and partial PV array mounting by the car owner's driving pattern, which results in more than 20{\%} PV cell cost reduction. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {Directly harnessed solar power is an attractive primary energy source for integration into fully wire-free, self-sufficient, portable electronic devices. Maximum power (MPP) tracking of photovoltaic (PV) cells is an essential part of PV energy harvesting and several methods are available to track MPP efficiently. With more than one cell, power-balancing is also a significant concern and global MPP tracking, parallel connection of PV cells, and active array reconfiguration are all techniques designed to address this issue. This work shrinks array reconfiguration from two-dimensional arrays of PV cells to a single string of PV cells, which are particularly relevant to portable systems. Each string element has individual MPP tracking and power balancing at low circuit complexity using a modular, time-domain array-reconfiguration (TDAR) approach. Both, a discrete control loop that demonstrates the concept and a 150 $\mu$W microchip that implements TDAR for three PV cells were developed. The energy harvesting efficiency of the TDAR approach is more than 80{\%} improved compared to static (non-reconfigurable) strings of PV cells. While other array reconfiguration approaches can offer comparable improvements in efficiency, the reduced complexity of the TDAR approach makes it the only scalable approach that can be practically applied to array reconfiguration in portable systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic power systems are usually integrated with some specific control algorithms to deliver the maximum possible power. Several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods that force the operating point to oscillate have been presented in the past few decades. In the MPPT system, the ideal operation is to determine the maximum power point (MPP) of the photovoltaic (PV) array directly rather than to track it by using the active operation of trial and error, which causes undesirable oscillation around the MPP. Since the output features of a PV cell vary with environment changes in irradiance and temperature from time to time, real-time operation is required to trace the variations of local MPPs in PV power systems. The method of real-time estimation proposed in this paper uses polynomials to demonstrate the power-voltage relationship of PV panels and implements the recursive least-squares method and Newton-Raphson method to identify the voltage of the optimal operating point. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is successfully demonstrated by computer simulations and experimental evaluations of two major types of PV panels, namely: 1) crystalline silicon and 2) copper-indium-diselenide thin film},

abstract = {"Preface Photovoltaic (PV) systems are nowadays producing a significant amount of the electrical energy used all around the world. The support the PV technology can offer in the next decades, to the rate of growth of the advanced economies as well as of the developing Countries, is very high. The incentives provided at a first stage by the European governments have resulted in the rapid growth of the photovoltaic market and in the increase of the number and quality of products offered by the industries. PV modules by many producers are nowadays commercially available and a number of power electronic systems have been put on the Market for processing the electric power produced by PV systems, especially for grid connected applications. Also the scientific literature concerning PV applications has been characterized by a strong quantitative and qualitative growth in the last decade. A huge number of papers has been written and continues to be published in many journals; moreover, high impact factor scientific journals which are specifically devoted to photovoltaic systems are printed. A significant number of scientific papers is dedicated to the control of the photovoltaic source. A simple search on the Reuters Thomson website reveals that, at the end of May 2012, about 600 papers include the Maximum Power Point Tracking among their keywords. Many authors have contributed to the scientific field of the circuits and systems ensuring the best operation of the photovoltaic generator, but a reference in this field is still lacking.

abstract = {Equivalent circuit models are a hot research topic in the field of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, and scholars have proposed a variety of equivalent circuit models, from simple to complex. On one hand, a simple model cannot simulate the dynamic characteristics of batteries; on the other hand, it is difficult to apply a complex model to a real-time system. At present, there are few systematic comparative studies on equivalent circuit models of lithium-ion batteries. The representative first-order resistor-capacitor (RC) model and second-order RC model commonly used in the literature are studied comparatively in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the two models are identified experimentally; secondly, the simulation model is built in Matlab/Simulink environment, and finally the output precision of these two models is verified by the actual data. The results show that in the constant current condition, the maximum error of the first-order RC model is 1.65{\%} and the maximum error for the second-order RC model is 1.22{\%}. In urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) condition, the maximum error of the first-order RC model is 1.88{\%}, and for the second-order RC model the maximum error is 1.69{\%}. This is of great instructional significance to the application in practical battery management systems for the equivalent circuit model of lithium-ion batteries of electric vehicles.},

abstract = {As per energy efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) system is concerned, partial shading is an important issue. Under partial shading condition, the modules of a PV array receive different levels of solar irradiation, so the power generation of a PV system decreases. The power-voltage characteristic of a partially shaded PV array contains multiple local maxima, and the global maximum power point is one of them. The losses in a PV array depend on the shading pattern and the physical location of shaded modules. This paper presents the Futoshiki puzzle pattern for the arrangement of the modules of a PV array under partial shading condition, ensuring the enhancement of the power generation with respect to totally crossed tired (TCT) structure. In this method, the physical locations of modules in a TCT structure PV array are rearranged without changing the electrical connection of the modules. A comparison between the power generation in TCT and Futoshiki puzzle pattern configuration is presented. It is demonstrated that the power generated by a PV array in the Futoshiki configuration method is enhanced, and mismatch loss (ML) is minimized under different shading patterns by theoretical, simulation, and experimental results.},

This strategy was based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). If shading or malfunctions of the photovoltaic module array occur, the module array immediately undergoes adaptive reconfiguration to increase the power output of the PV power generation system. First, the maximal power generated at various irradiation levels and temperatures was recorded during normal array operation. Subsequently, the irradiation level and module temperature, regardless of operating conditions, were used to recall the maximal power previously recorded. This previous maximum was compared with the maximal power value obtained using the maximum power point tracker to assess whether the PV module array was experiencing shading or malfunctions. After determining that the array was experiencing shading or malfunctions, PSO was used to identify the optimal module array connection scheme in abnormal conditions, and connection switches were used to implement optimal array reconfiguration. Finally, experiments were conducted to assess the strategy for identifying the optimal reconfiguration of a PV module array in the event of shading or malfunctions.},

Determining the state-of-charge becomes an important issue in all battery applications including electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) or portable devices. The aim of this innovative study is to estimate the SOC of a high capacity lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery cell from an experimental data-set obtained in the University of Oviedo Battery Laboratory (UOB Lab) using support vector machine (SVM) approach. The SOC of a battery cannot be measured directly and must be estimated from measurable battery parameters such as current, voltage or temperature. An accurate predictive model able to forecast the SOC in the short term is obtained. The agreement of the SVM model with the experimental data-set confirmed its good performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {As users pan and zoom, display content can disappear into off-screen space, particularly on small-screen devices. The clipping of locations, such as relevant places on a map, can make spatial cognition tasks harder. Halo is a visualization technique that supports spatial cognition by showing users the location of off-screen objects. Halo accomplishes this by surrounding off-screen objects with rings that are just large enough to reach into the border region of the display window. From the portion of the ring that is visible on-screen, users can infer the off-screen location of the object at the center of the ring. We report the results of a user study comparing Halo with an arrow-based visualization technique with respect to four types of map-based route planning tasks. When using the Halo interface, users completed tasks 16-33{\%} faster, while there were no significant differences in error rate for three out of four tasks in our study.},

abstract = {Solar cell models implemented in simulation packages (for example Sentaurus TCAD) are typically restricted either to only one or two dimensions, or to small scales. They therefore neglect effects of local inhomogeneities or largescale phenomena such as lateral transport to fingers or busbars. In this paper, we use a distributed circuit model to investigate lateral inhomogeneity effects on silicon wafer solar cells. The circuit is constructed of different unit elements based on the one-diode model. To calculate the characteristics of the circuit, we use the freely available software LTspice IV (Linear Technology Corp). The presented model is used to simulate the distributed current flow in a solar cell. First, the design of the distributed circuit model is described. Then, the current-voltage characteristics obtained by the distributed circuit model are compared with those obtained from measurements. Finally, one kind of large-scale lateral effect, the voltage distribution across the solar cell area, is analysed. Due to lateral ohmic voltage drops, the electric potential at the cell surface is shown to be higher in the middle between two busbars or fingers than close to them. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

During partial shading condition, irradiance received by the modules are different that leads to decrease in power generation from the SPV system. In this paper, the effect of partial shading is investigated for SPV arrays having different interconnection topologies to realize a configuration that can be a solution for all types of shading patterns. The three widely interconnection topologies namely Series-Parallel (SP), Bridge-Linked (BL) and Total Cross Tied (TCT) have been chosen for comparison. A comparison in power generation and mismatch power losses among these connections is done using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and a prototype field experiment under different irradiance and shading patterns. The connections are studied in presence and absence of bypass diodes. It have been authenticated that despite of redundancy, TCT can be implemented in larger SPV arrays to enhance power generation under different shading patterns that results in minimization of mismatch loss in SPV system.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to optimize the capacity of battery used in a grid-connected photovoltaic system (PV/storage system). Scheduling of the battery after installation has to be considered for the optimal design; because battery degradationcost is mainly a function of system operation. In this paper, peak shaving and load shifting which are important applications of PV/storage systems are studied. Load shifting is mostly implemented when time-of-use pricing is in effect and peak shaving is beneficial when utility customers are charged for peak of demand. In order to account for seasonality in system net load, data clustering techniques are implemented to produce scenarios for net load of the customer. Then, the proposed Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model of the optimization problem is solved. To illustrate the important cost of battery degradations, a model of non-ideal battery is also studied and the results are compared with the case which ideal model of battery is used. Results show that sizing determination of the battery highly depends on the exact pricing structure. In addition, it is illustrated that, considering real assumptions for battery ageing is necessary to reliably estimate financial benefits of storages in PV/storage systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many electronic systems such as robotics, battery-powered electric vehicles, and mobile computing devices are powered by multi-cell battery with limited energy capacity. Therefore, maximizing the battery performance such as operating time, available capacity, and lifetime is one of the major battery design challenges. Traditional approaches such as dynamic power management to maximize the battery discharge performance have treated multi-cell battery as a pure passive component with a fixed configuration. Thus, the multi-cell battery performance is determined by the weakest battery cell, leading to a low utilization of battery energy. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-cell battery design to dynamically reconfigure the cell topology of a multi-cell battery, which also interacts with the power management module of a battery-powered system to maximize the battery discharge performance. Then, the dynamic reconfiguration problem of the multi-cell battery is formulated as a Lagrangian Relaxation problem and solved by dynamic programming. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed design can significantly enhance the multi-cell battery operating time and useable capacity. Moreover, the proposed design can automatically exclude the failure or malfunction cells through reconfiguration, which can greatly improve the multi-cell battery safety. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This paper aims to develop a reliable and accurate model for online, simultaneous state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations of Li-ion batteries. Through the analysis of battery cycle-life test data, the instantaneous discharging voltage (V) and its unit time voltage drop, V', are proposed as the model parameters for the SOC equation. The SOH equation is found to have a linear relationship with 1/V' times the modification factor, which is a function of SOC. Four batteries are tested in the laboratory, and the data are regressed for the model coefficients. The results show that the model built upon the data from one single cell is able to estimate the SOC and SOH of the three other cells within a 5{\%} error bound. The derived model is also proven to be robust. A random sampling test to simulate the online real-time SOC and SOH estimation proves that this model is accurate and can be potentially used in an electric vehicle battery management system (BMS).},

The proposed approach is intended for the evaluation of the long-term energetic performances of photovoltaic fields on a daily, monthly or yearly basis where a fast computation process must be achieved. Two aspects characterize the novel modeling approach: the first one is the evaluation in closed form of the inflection voltage points which represent, in mismatched conditions, the array voltages where the bypass diodes turn off. The second one is the identification of a new set of non-linear equations that describe the photovoltaic field in a simple way, thus speeding up the model solution and the evaluation of the operating voltage and current. The model employs a simple analytical formulation of the photovoltaic field characteristics, allowing a fast evaluation of the energetic performance of different configurations to select the most efficient one in a given irradiance and temperature conditions. The performance of the proposed solution was contrasted with a traditional model obtaining satisfactory results. Finally, numerical examples based on experimental irradiance measurements illustrate the usefulness of the model in the evaluation of photovoltaic field configurations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Dynamical reconfiguration is receiving attention from the scientific community because of the advantages it can ensure with respect to module-dedicated electronics when partial shadowing of the photovoltaic field occurs. Indeed, lower cost and conversion losses as well as improved diagnostic capabilities make this solution of high interest for industrialization in a near future. Some stochastic algorithms have been proposed recently for determining the best electrical connection among the panels that ensures the highest power production for the actual shadowing pattern. In this paper, no novel reconfiguration algorithm is proposed, but the optimized implementation of one of such recently proposed approaches is described. The advantages achieved by using a system-on-chip platform, through a suitable exploitation of the features it offers, are highlighted. The experimental results confirm that the use of a system-on-chip platform gives significant benefits for the proposed application. Indeed the parallelization of the algorithm allows to reduce the execution time greatly with respect to what can be achieved through a standard software implementation.},

abstract = {The penetration of renewable sources in the power system network in the power system has been increasing in the recent years. These sources are intermittent in nature and their generation pattern does not match the load pattern thereby creating a need for a battery storage system. In this context, energy management presents itself as inevitable challenge in operating a grid connected distributed renewable sources. The challenge is due to factors such as intermittency of source, time of the day prices, sizing of solar panels and battery, limitations of charging and discharging rates of the battery. In this paper, one of the solutions being proposed to improve the reliability and performance of these systems is to integrate energy storage device into the power system network. This paper discusses the modelling of photovoltaic and status of the storage device such as lead acid battery for better energy management in the system. The energy management for the grid connected system was performed by the dynamic switching process. The optimal selection of number of solar panels, battery size has also been presented. The proposed algorithm helps in effectively deriving the potential benefits of grid connected rooftop solar system with battery storage.},

The reconstruction of power vs. voltage curve is obtained by one explicit equation, thus avoiding the use of recursive non-linear equations solver.

As it entails no fuel price risk or constraints, it also improves security of supply. Solar power enhances energy diversity and hedges against price volatility of fossil fuels, thus stabilising costs of electricity generation in the long term. Solar PV entails no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during operation and does not emit other pollutants (such as oxides of sulphur and nitrogen); additionally, it consumes no or little water. As local air pollution and extensive use of fresh water for cooling of thermal power plants are becoming serious concerns in hot or dry regions, these benefits of solar PV become increasingly important.},

abstract = {The increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy generators opens up opportunities for grid-connected energy storage. Batteries offer significant flexibility but are relatively expensive at present. Battery lifetime is a key factor in the business case, and it depends on usage, but most techno-economic analyses do not account for this. For the first time, this paper quantifies the annual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical dynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery models of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of each is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set (Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11{\%} to 5{\%} is found by increasing the model accuracy. The three models are then used within an optimal control algorithm to perform price arbitrage over one year, including degradation. Results show that the revenue can be increased substantially while degradation can be reduced by using more realistic models. The estimated best case profit using a sophisticated model is a 175{\%} improvement compared with the simplest model. This illustrates that using a simplistic battery model in a techno-economic assessment of grid-connected batteries might substantially underestimate the business case and lead to erroneous conclusions.},

@article{Remmlinger2011,
abstract = {For reliable and safe operation of lithium-ion batteries in electric or hybrid vehicles, diagnosis of the cell degradation is necessary. This can be achieved by monitoring the increase of the internal resistance of the battery cells over the whole lifetime of the battery. In this paper, a method to identify the internal resistance in a hybrid vehicle is presented. Therefore, a special purpose model deduced from an equivalent circuit is developed. This model contains parameters depending on the degradation of the battery cell. To achieve the required robustness and stable results under these conditions, the method uses specific signal intervals occurring during normal operation of the battery in a hybrid vehicle. This identification signal has a defined timespan and occurs regularly. The identification is done on vehicle measurement data of terminal cell voltage and current collected with a usual vehicle sampling rate. Using the adapted internal resistance value in the model, a degradation index is calculated by compensating other influences, e.g. battery temperature. This task is the main challenge, as the impact of the temperature on the resistance, for example, is one order of magnitude higher than the influence of the degradation for the investigated lithium-ion cell. The developed estimation and monitoring method is validated with measurement data from single cells and shows good results and very low computational effort. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of fossil fuels, the electric vehicles (EVs) receive massive popularity due to their performances and efficiencies in recent decades. EVs have already been widely accepted in the automotive industries considering the most promising replacements in reducing CO2 emissions and global environmental issues. Lithium-ion batteries have attained huge attention in EVs application due to their lucrative features such as lightweight, fast charging, high energy density, low self-discharge and long lifespan. This paper comprehensively reviews the lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation and its management system towards the sustainable future EV applications. The significance of battery management system (BMS) employing lithium-ion batteries is presented, which can guarantee a reliable and safe operation and assess the battery SOC. The review identifies that the SOC is a crucial parameter as it signifies the remaining available energy in a battery that provides an idea about charging/discharging strategies and protect the battery from overcharging/over discharging. It is also observed that the SOC of the existing lithium-ion batteries have a good contribution to run the EVs safely and efficiently with their charging/discharging capabilities. However, they still have some challenges due to their complex electro-chemical reactions, performance degradation and lack of accuracy towards the enhancement of battery performance and life. The classification of the estimation methodologies to estimate SOC focusing with the estimation model/algorithm, benefits, drawbacks and estimation error are extensively reviewed. The review highlights many factors and challenges with possible recommendations for the development of BMS and estimation of SOC in next-generation EV applications. All the highlighted insights of this review will widen the increasing efforts towards the development of the advanced SOC estimation method and energy management system of lithium-ion battery for the future high-tech EV applications.},

abstract = {Accurately estimating the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery is the basis of Battery Management System (BMS). This paper has introduced a new modeling and state estimation method for the lithium battery system, which utilizes the fractional order theories. Firstly, a fractional order model based on the PNGV (Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicle) model is proposed after analyzing the impedance characteristics of the lithium battery and compared with the integer order model. With the observability of the discrete non-linear model of the battery confirmed, the method of the state observer based on the extended fractional Kalman filter (EFKF) and the least square identification method of battery parameters are studied. Then, it has been applied successfully to estimate the battery SOC using the measured battery current and voltage. Finally, a standard HPPC (Hybrid Pulse Power Characteristic) test is used for parameter identification and several experimental validations are investigated on a ternary manganese-nickel-cobalt lithium battery pack with a nominal capacity of 24 Ah which consists of ten Sony commercial cells (US18650GR G7) in parallels. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional order model and the estimation method.},

abstract = {Partial shading of a photovoltaic array is the condition under which different modules in the array experience different irradiance levels due to shading. This difference causes mismatch between the modules, leading to undesirable effects such as reduction in generated power and hot spots. The severity of these effects can be considerably reduced by photovoltaic array reconfiguration. This paper proposes a novel mathematical formulation for the optimal reconfiguration of photovoltaic arrays to minimize partial shading losses. The paper formulates the reconfiguration problem as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem and finds the optimal solution using a branch and bound algorithm. The proposed formulation can be used for an equal or nonequal number of modules per row. Moreover, it can be used for fully reconfigurable or partially reconfigurable arrays. The improvement resulting from the reconfiguration with respect to the existing photovoltaic interconnections is demonstrated by extensive simulation results.},

The main objective is to find the parameters of the nonlinear I-V equation by adjusting the curve at three points: open circuit, maximum power, and short circuit.

With the parameters of the adjusted I-V equation, one can build a PV circuit model with any circuit simulator by using basic math blocks. The modeling method and the proposed circuit model are useful for power electronics designers who need a simple, fast, accurate, and easy-to-use modeling method for using in simulations of PV systems. In the first pages, the reader will find a tutorial on PV devices and will understand the parameters that compose the single-diode PV model. The modeling method is then introduced and presented in details. The model is validated with experimental data of commercial PV arrays.},

This paper identifies four areas to further increase the power yield and significantly reduce the time for a return on investment. Results indicate potential efficiency improvements of more than 10{\%} in some cases, and between 4-10{\%} across a number of random and abrupt shading conditions. As in any DPVA system the proposed approaches require additional hardware and advanced control algorithms compared to a static PV array, but anyone implementing a dynamic array has already committed themselves to including the majority of this infrastructure. This investigation supports the idea of a fully dynamic IEq-DPVA with the ability to resize its array dimensions while implementing a rapid sorting algorithm based on information gathered using a novel precision irradiance profiling technique.},

abstract = {Lightweight, flexible PV (FPV) modules are suitable for BIPV and stand-alone applications where contoured layouts are required and system weight is a constraint. This report focuses on optimization of a contoured FPV array which operates under Non Uniform Illumination (NUI) conditions. NUI conditions can occur at low solar angle for contoured layouts and also due to unexpected partial shading events. The output Power Voltage (P-V) characteristics under contouring and partial shading demonstrate severe oscillatory behavior around the maximum power region, which results in inefficient implementation of established tracking algorithms that seek to detect a dominant global maxima. An algorithm for MPP tracking has been proposed that takes into account both static and dynamic parameters. An integrated test system has been developed which can accurately monitor solar irradiance (range 100-1000 Watts/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and solar angle and load dependent instantaneous output voltage and current. The system has been designed for maximum current and voltage rating of 3A and 25V respectively. While an output power penalty results due to contouring, our results show a very small energy differential up to a maximum array contour value of 10{\&}{\#}x00B0;. This analysis may lead to development of novel, flexible PV array based designs.},

This review aims to serve as a guideline for best choice of battery technology, system design and operation for lithium-ion based storage systems to match a specific system application. Starting with an overview to lithium-ion battery technologies and their characteristics with respect to performance and aging, the storage system design is analyzed in detail based on an evaluation of real-world projects. Typical storage system applications are grouped and classified with respect to the challenges posed to the battery system. Publicly available modeling tools for technical and economic analysis are presented. A brief analysis of optimization approaches aims to point out challenges and potential solution techniques for system sizing, positioning and dispatch operation. For all areas reviewed herein, expected improvements and possible future developments are highlighted. In order to extract the full potential of stationary battery storage systems and to enable increased profitability of systems, future research should aim to a holistic system level approach combining not only performance tuning on a battery cell level and careful analysis of the application requirements, but also consider a proper selection of storage sub-components as well as an optimized system operation strategy.},

Under the current energy sector framework of electricity tariff in Malaysia, commercial and industrial customers are required to pay the maximum demand (MD) charge apart from the net consumption charges every month. The maximum demand charge will contribute up to 20{\%} of the electricity bill, and will hence result in commercial and industrial customers focussing on alternative energy supply to minimize the billing cost. This paper aims to review the technical assessment methods of a grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV)-battery storage system-with respect to maximum demand shaving. An effective battery storage system can provide the extra energy needed during the peak energy consumption periods, as well as when renewable energy (RE) sources go offline. Based on the reviews, maximum demand shaving with good Return-of-Investment (ROI) can be achieved by considering the actual load profile, technical, and economic aspects of the solar PV-battery system and the Malaysian electricity tariff for commercial and industrial customers.},

abstract = {When the panels in a photovoltaic (PV) array are subjected to a nonuniform irradiance level, some bypass diodes may turn ON, and the overall power production might be affected significantly. An increase of the power delivered by the whole array might be obtained by means of its electrical reconfiguration, that is, the change of the series–parallel connection among the panels of which it is made up. The computation of the electrical connection among the panels that ensures the maximum delivered power is a combinatorial problem requiring powerful optimization methods. This paper is devoted to the formulation of an optimization procedure for determining the best electrical configuration among the panels. The proposed algorithm requires simple mathematical calculations, and it uses a vectorized structure; thus, it is suitable to be implemented in any embedded system for the purpose of a real-time PV array reconfiguration. The algorithm is first explained by using a pilot example, and afterward, its performance is shown by applying it to a real domestic PV field. The results show that the optimization algorithm computes an optimized configuration with a low computational burden.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles powered with large-scale battery packs are gaining popularity as gasoline price soars. Large-scale battery packs usually consist of an estimated 12,000 battery cells connected in series and parallel, which are susceptible to battery-cell failures. Unfortunately, current battery-management systems are unable to handle the inevitable battery-cell failures very well. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic reconfiguration framework that monitors, reconfigures, and controls large-scale battery packs online. The framework is built upon a syntactic bypassing mechanism that provides a set of rules for changing the battery-pack configuration, and a semantic bypassing mechanism by which the battery-cell connectivity is reconfigured to recover from a battery-cell failure. In particular, the semantic bypassing mechanism is dictated by constant-voltage-keeping and dynamic-voltage-allowing policies. The former policy is effective in preventing unavoidable voltage drops during the battery discharge, while the latter policy is effective in supplying different amounts of power to meet a wide-range of application requirements. Our experimental evaluation has shown the proposed framework to enable the battery packs to be 9 times as fault-tolerant as a legacy scheme.},

abstract = {Low power dissipation and maximum battery runtime are crucial in portable electronics. With accurate and efficient circuit and battery models in hand, circuit designers can predict and optimize battery runtime and circuit performance. In this paper, an accurate, intuitive, and comprehensive electrical battery model is proposed and implemented in a Cadence environment. This model accounts for all dynamic characteristics of the battery, from nonlinear open-circuit voltage, current-, temperature-, cycle number-, and storage time-dependent capacity to transient response. A simplified model neglecting the effects of self-discharge, cycle number, and temperature, which are nonconsequential in low-power Li-ion-supplied applications, is validated with experimental data on NiMH and polymer Li-ion batteries. Less than 0.4{\%} runtime error and 30-mV maximum error voltage show that the proposed model predicts both the battery runtime and I-V performance accurately. The model can also be easily extended to other battery and power sourcing technologies.},

The EAR strategy is carried out by inserting a controllable switching matrix between the PV generator and the central inverter, which allows the electrical reconnection of the available PV modules. As a result, the PV system exhibits a self-capacity for real-time adaptation to the PV generator external operating conditions and improves the energy extraction of the system.

Therefore, the availability of battery and voltage converter models providing accurate estimates of battery lifetime is key for system-level low-power design frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-time model for the complete power supply subsystem that closely approximates the behaviour of its circuit-level continuous-time counterpart. The model is abstract and efficient enough to enable event-driven simulation of digital systems described at a very high level of abstraction and that includes, among their components, also the power supply. The model gives the designer the possibility of estimating battery lifetime during system-level design exploration, as shown by the results we have collected on meaningful case studies. In addition, it is flexible and it can thus be employed for different battery chemistries.},

abstract = {The power vs. voltage curve of a photovoltaic string operating under mismatched conditions can exhibit more than one maximum power point (MPP). In this paper, a direct method for the estimation of these points using explicit equations is introduced. The method employs a piecewise linear approximation of the current vs. voltage curve of each photovoltaic panel in the string and assumes that the open circuit voltage and the position of the maximum power points of each panel are known. Numerical results comparing the performances of the proposed approach with those offered by the adoption of the accurate single diode model show that the computational burden is reduced by almost four orders of magnitude. The approach is validated by experimental results exhibiting estimation errors lower than 5{\%}. The satisfactory trade-off between accuracy and computation time provided by the proposed method is illustrated using two application examples: reconfiguration and long-term power production of PV strings. Moreover, an in-depth comparison of the existing simplified methods to estimate the MPPs has been performed.},

In the optimisation, an objective function is defined, in which a minimum number of switches and maximum capability for realising different desired configurations are taken into account. Although the result is a SWS with the capability of reconfiguring PV panels in different series–parallel configurations, the algorithm can be extended for deriving different SWSs aimed to realise other configurations.

The severity of these effects can be considerably reduced by dynamic reconfiguration of the array.

abstract = {Background: Chronic nicotine administration has a dual effect on bowel disease: augmentation of jejunitis and amelioration of colitis. We previously showed that chronic nicotine administration has divergent regional effects on small bowel and colonic mucosal mediators and blood flow. Objectives: To examine tne effects of nicotine administration on cytokine levels in informal rat small bowel mucosa, colohic mucosa, and blood. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were given nicotine (12.5 $\mu$g/ml) that was dissolved in tap water. Rats were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 7 and 14 after nicotine initiation; blood was withdrawn, and small bowel and colon were resected, washed and weighed. Mucosal scrapings were extracted in 2 ml Krebs-Hemselest buffer for determination of interieukins-2, 6 and 10 using the Biosource International Immunoassay Kit. Results: Nicotine decreased IL-10 and increased IL-6 levels in small bvowel mucosa (from 3.5 ± 0.5 to 0.4 ± 0.1 pg/ml and from 1.9 ± 0.4 pg/ml respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Nicotine decreased IL-2 levels in the colon (from 15.8 ± 3.0 to 7.9 ± 1.0 pg/ml; P {\textless} 0.05), having no effect on IL-10 or IL-6 levels. Rats treated, with nicotine had lower IL-6 and IL-2 blood levels compared to control rats, Conclusions: Nicotine has different regional effects on small bowel and colonic cytokine mucosal levels, which might explain some of its opposite effects on small bowel and colonic inflammation.},

If one of the PV panels or more are shaded, dusty or faulty the connection of the others in the same group will be automatically modified to maintain the requested load output voltage. This dynamical reconfiguration allows also limiting the lost power, due to the incriminate panel, by switching off this panels and reconfiguration the topology. As a result, a real time adaptation of a switch matrix allows a self-ability to maintain a constant load voltage. Moreover, a minimum number of PV panels are switched off by isolating the effect of unhealthy panels. In addition, the proposed solution can also be applied for identifying and locating the shaded, dusty and faulty panel.

abstract = {Battery state-of-charge (SOC) is a key parameter of the battery management system in the electric vehicle. To predict the practicable capacity of the battery in the degradation process, the cycle life model is built based on the aging cycle tests of the 6Ah Lithium Ion battery. Combined with the cycle life model, a new Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) model is proposed to eliminate the battery degradation's effect on the SOC estimation accuracy of the original trained model. This proposed model is verified through the 6Ah Lithium Ion battery. First, Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and Economic Commission of Europe (ECE) cycles are experimented on the batteries under different temperatures and aging levels. Then, the robustness of the new RBFNN model against different aging levels, temperatures and loading profiles is tested with the datasets of the experiments and compared against the conventional neural network model. The simulations show that the new model can improve the accuracy of the SOC estimation effectively and has a good robustness against varying aging cycles, temperatures and loading profiles. Finally, the measurement of actual aging cycles of the battery in electric vehicles is discussed for the SOC estimation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic power systems lose significant amount of energy due to partial shading which occurs when a part of a PV system is shaded while the rest is fully illuminated. These losses appear in the form of mismatch power losses. Minimizing these losses is fortunately possible through reconfiguring the connections of PV modules in a PV system, as reported recently in the literature. However, the available reconfiguration methods are based on biological optimization which needs long computational time to search for the optimal configuration. Unfortunately, this hinders their practical implementation in large PV systems. A reconfiguration technique that finds the optimal configuration in a reduced computational time is proposed in this paper. Simple rules are developed that can determine the best PV configuration without the need to solve heavy optimization problems. The validity and superiority of the proposed method is verified by comparing its performance to the existing methods under various shading scenarios.},

abstract = {Performance of a solar photovoltaic (SPV) array is affected by variations in temperature, solar insolation and array configuration. At times, the SPV arrays are susceptible to non-uniform illumination due to shading caused by passing cloud, towers, trees etc. The effect of partial shading is critical; it can cause problems such as irregular P-V characteristics (multiple peaks) which makes power optimization difficult by the conventional power extraction techniques and results in significant loss of power. In most SPV systems, a DC-DC converter is connected at the SPV output to compensate for the drop in the PV output voltage. Under shaded conditions, a high gain DC-DC converter is needed to boost the low SPV voltage, which leads to additional power loss. Under such conditions, an appropriate reconfiguration scheme may prove to be beneficial as it ensures a certain minimum voltage for the next stage, obviating the need for high voltage gain, thereby reducing the power losses in the DC- DC converter. Under non-uniform illumination conditions, the P-V characteristics may exhibit multiple peaks. In the absence of reconfiguration, the conventional power optimization technique will get trapped at the local maxima and result in loss of power. While reconfiguration shows advantage in power as well as makes the P-V characteristics less irregular making the convergence to the maximum power point easier. This paper proposes a reconfiguration strategy which ensures a certain minimum deviation from the operating voltage with improvement in power. A reconfigurable 4x4 solar PV cell array is designed. The experimental results for a 4x4 cell array demonstrating the reconfiguration strategy showing improvement in power has been included.

abstract = {Partial shading can dramatically reduce the power output of a PV array as well as complicate operation by causing multiple peaks to appear in the power-voltage (P-V) characteristic curve. The extent of these problems depends not only on the shading area but also and much more significantly on the shading pattern. In this paper three new physical PV array arrangements are proposed to mitigate partial shading effects. The arrangements are based on maximizing the distance between adjacent PV modules within a PV array by appropriately arranging modules in different rows and columns without changing the electrical connections. A systematic analysis is performed to assess the proposed PV array arrangements under different shading patterns and scenarios, and to compare performance with existing configurations. The new arrangements are shown to effectively (i) redistribute shading patterns over the entire PV array, (ii) minimize protection diodes power dissipation, (iii) eliminate multiple peaks, and (iv) maximize power output. The analysis considers shading scenarios related to cloud shape, size, transmissivity and passage over an array. The new configurations simplify operation and improve performance significantly compared to the reference Series-Parallel (SP) and Total Cross Tied (TCT) configurations: the characteristic P-V curves exhibit a single peak allowing tracking of the maximum power point with a simple controller removing the need for complex controller algorithms and costly hardware, and the power output gains range from 19 to 140{\%} compared to SP, and 13 to 68{\%} compared to TCT.},

abstract = {Quantitative information regarding the maximum power point (MPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays is crucial for determining and controlling their operation, yet it is difficult to obtain such information through direct measurements. PV arrays exhibit an extremely nonlinear currentvoltage (IV) characteristic that varies with many complex factors related to the individual cells, which makes it difficult to ensure an optimal use of the available solar energy and to achieve maximum power output in real time. Finding ways to obtain the maximum power output in real time under all possible system conditions are indispensable to the development of feasible PV generation systems. The conventional methods for tracking the MPP of PV arrays suffer from a serious problem that the MPP cannot be quickly acquired. Based on the pn junction semiconductor theory, we develop a prediction method for directly estimating the MPP for power tracking in PV arrays. The proposed method is a new and simple approach with a low calculation burden that takes the resistance effect of the solar cells into consideration. The MPP of PV arrays can be directly determined from an irradiated IV characteristic curve. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by examining the characteristics of the MPP of PV arrays depending on both the temperature and irradiation intensity, and the results are discussed in detail. Such performance is also tested using the field data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method helps in the optimization of the MPP control model in PV arrays. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In many applications, the current versus voltage curve of a photovoltaic cell, module, string, or field is acquired. A high number of samples are usually acquired, but the curve contains the main information in the open- and short-circuit points, as well as where it has a strong change in the slope. In this paper, these parts are called "the fingerprint" of the photovoltaic generator. The fingerprint allows us to recognize the working conditions of the photovoltaic generator, e.g., if it is affected by a partial shadowing or not. Saving the fingerprint and discarding the other points of the original curve allows us to minimize the memory needs for storing the curve without losing the main information content. In this paper, a numerical technique for selecting, from among the samples of the acquired current versus voltage curve of any photovoltaic generator, the ones to be included in the fingerprint is proposed. The processing steps and the memory needed to achieve the result are minimized in order to allow an implementation of the algorithm also in a low-cost processor for on-field real-time applications. The technique is validated through curves generated by using analytical models as well as by means of some curves acquired experimentally in outdoor conditions.},

In this study, the relationship between the output improvement with reconnection and the switching interval is shown. For a 3-kW PV system, under conditions of cloudlessness and cloudiness, a sharp difference in the output improvement relative to the switching interval is not observed. However, under the condition of shading, the output improvement sharply decreases relative to the switching interval; the output improvement at a 1-min switching interval is 0.15 kWh.h (+22.4{\%}).

A vital aspect in energy storage planning and operations is to accurately model the aging cost of battery cells, especially in irregular cycling operations. This paper proposes a semiempirical lithium-ion battery degradation model that assesses battery cell life loss from operating profiles. We formulate the model by combining fundamental theories of battery degradation and our observations in battery aging test results. The model is adaptable to different types of lithium-ion batteries, and methods for tuning the model coefficients based on manufacturer's data are presented. A cycle-counting method is incorporated to identify stress cycles from irregular operations, allowing the degradation model to be applied to any battery energy storage (BES) applications. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated through an assessment of the degradation that a BES would incur by providing frequency control in the PJM regulation market.},

abstract = {This paper describes a universal computer model of charging system for accumulator batteries. Among many strategies and approaches of accumulator battery charge, the main of them all are those involving charge with constant current and voltage and combined ones with switching the constant current and/or voltage during the charge. To understand the difference of state of charge (SOC) after the charging process, we developed a mathematic model of accumulator battery-charging system with the Matlab/Simulink software {\{}[{\}}4] based on the battery cell model. The developed computer model contains a charging controller built on the base of the S-Function module in the Matlab/Simulink. The signals from voltage and temperature sensors of each cell were considered as the input information signals, and the commands for setting up the required charging current value for each cell complied with the output signals. We used the model of multi-channel oscilloscope as the measuring and recording equipment. Today, more and more scientists and engineers are being involved into the research of efficient storage and usage of electric energy. One of the important tasks in energy saving technologies is efficient charging of accumulator batteries. To solve this task, we have developed a universal computer model of charging system for accumulating batteries. The S-function module allows simplifying the research of different battery charging algorithms using the control program written with the high-level language that provides comfortable toolbox both in research activity and solving the application-oriented tasks.},

abstract = {In this study, the first order model and the second order equivalent circuit models of NiMH battery for electric vehicle were used to determinate the battery state of charge. Different parameters for equivalent circuit models were explained. There are four phases in the battery change and discharge, which are charge phase, change idle phase, discharge phase, discharge idle phase. All of these phases are discussed and analyzed. For different phas-es of charge and discharge, mathematical relationships between parameters and state of charge were built. The calculation results fit well with the experimental results. A precision comparison between the first order model and the second order model was undertaken. Keywords electric vehicles, NiMH battery, equivalent circuit models, state of charge, model parameters 1. INTRODUCTION State of charge (SOC) represents the residual capac-ity of the battery and it is written as the percent of residual capacity by nominal capacity. The estima-tion of SOC of NiMH battery is a key point of energy management system in EV/HEV. With accurate SOC, the battery can extend its age and avoid being over charged or over discharged [Jung et al., 2002]. Moreo-ver it is benefit for controller to implement control strategy in HEV. Many methods are used to improve the precision of SOC. It is very popular to estimate the SOC with Ampere hours (Ah) algorithm, which apply in EV/HEV. The battery capacity is measured in Ah algorithm which is calculated by multiplying the current by time of discharge [Koehler et al., 2001, Stiegeler et al., 2005]. The residual capacity is calculated by initial capac-ity minus capacity discharged. Researcher found it is more precise when it considers the compensation, such as temperature, discharge rate, self discharge and age [Youn et al., 2005]. But Ah algorithm has three shortcomings. First, it is impossible to forecast the ini-tial SOC. Second its estimation precision is dependent on the precision of sensor .Third, the accumulated er-ror can not be ignored with the test time growing. For longer time periods and operation where incomplete charging is concerned, Ah-balancing results in high errors [Kremer et al., 1995, Terry and Wang, 2005, Ha et al., 1992].},

This optimized and decentralized PV architecture can produce significantly more power than a static equivalent (by an average of 22.6{\%}) and also outperforms the sophisticated alternative known as an irradiance equalized dynamic photovoltaic array (IEq-DPVA) by an average of 13.7{\%} for the relevant tests carried out.

abstract = {Battery packs with a large number of battery cells are becoming more and more widely adopted in electronic systems, such as robotics, renewable energy systems, energy storage in smart grids, and electronic vehicles. Therefore, a well-designed battery pack is essential for battery applications. In the literature, the majority of research in battery pack design focuses on battery management system, safety circuit, and cell-balancing strategies. Recently, the reconfigurable battery pack design has gained increasing attentions as a promising solution to solve the problems existing in the conventional battery packs and associated battery management systems, such as low energy efficiency, short pack lifespan, safety issues, and low reliability. One of the most prominent features of reconfigurable battery packs is that the battery cell topology can be dynamically reconfigured in the real-time fashion based on the current condition (in terms of the state of charge and the state of health) of battery cells. So far, there are several reconfigurable battery schemes having been proposed and validated in the literature, all sharing the advantage of cell topology reconfiguration that ensures balanced cell states during charging and discharging, meanwhile providing strong fault tolerance ability. This survey is undertaken with the intent of identifying the state-of-the-art technologies of reconfigurable battery as well as providing review on related technologies and insight on future research in this emerging area.},

@article{Hu2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2001-2011 IEEE. In the past decades, a large number of photovoltaic (PV) plants have been built. Due to the minor physical differences between PV cells and the influence of environmental factors such as rains, temperature, and humidity, the aging of a PV array is often distributed unevenly within each PV module. This non-uniform aging causes further decreased output power, which is often easily observed for large size PV arrays. Although the global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) strategy can improve the output power, the GMPPT cannot exploit the maximal power generation potential from non-uniform aging PV arrays. In order to exploit further the power generation potential and extend the service time of non-uniform aging PV arrays, a novel PV array reconfiguration method is developed in this paper. The concept of cell unit is applied to investigate the aging phenomenon of PV modules, and each PV module is assumed to be composed of three submodules, while these three submodules within any single PV module might have different aging conditions and, thus, different power-output capacities. The challenge is how to rearrange the PV array under the cases where: 1) each PV module has non-uniformly aged cell units; 2) there are a large number of PV modules; and 3) the voltage working range is restricted. To solve these problems, a nonlinear integer programming problem is formulated to maximize the power output under the constraints of non-uniformly aging and voltage restrictions. A small size 7×10 PV array is simulated to illustrate the proposed method. Furthermore, medium size 20×10 and large size 125×20 PV arrays are employed to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. A 1.5 kW 2×4 real PV array under non-uniform aging conditions is presented and experimentally tested to confirm the proposed rearrangement method.},

The proposed scheme facilitates distribution of the effect of shading over the entire array thereby reducing the mismatch losses caused by partial shading. The performance of the system is investigated for different shading conditions and the MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented to show that the power extracted from the PV arrays under partial shading conditions is improved.

abstract = {A battery management system (BMS) ensures performance, safety and longevity of a battery energy storage system in an embedded environment. One important task for a BMS is to estimate the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) of a battery. The correlation between battery open circuit voltage (OCV) and SoC is an important reference for state estimation. The OCV-SoC correlation changes with respect to battery degradation. To improve the accuracy of state estimation, it is important to have the OCV-SoC correlation updated periodically. This work presents a solution by proposing a novel SoH(SoC) correlation as part of the battery equivalent circuit model (ECM). On-line optimization of SoH(SoC) correlation implicitly optimizes the OCV(SoC) correlation, as well as the capacity of a battery. An associated state and parameter dual estimator is proposed incorporating an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as a state observer, Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm as an internal resistance identifier, and Parameter Varying Approach as the SoH(SoC) correlation identifier. Battery experiment and simulation results validate that updating the SoH-SoC correlation effectively tracks battery SoH on-line. Furthermore, it implicitly updates OCV(SoC) function, further improving SoC estimation accuracy by 0.5{\%}∼3{\%}.},

Further, partial shaded conditions increase the mismatch losses and reduce the output of the photovoltaic (PV) array significantly. The size of the PV array is to be increased under such circumstances to meet the desired specifications. This, in turn, increases the return of investment period that makes power generation by PV systems less attractive. This paper focuses on the various techniques that could negate the impact of partial shading and enhance the output under such conditions. In order to improve the power extraction under partial shaded conditions, various solutions modifying either the power processing architecture or the PV generator architecture have already been proposed. This paper reviews the latter approach and proposes a static architecture to negate the impact of partial shading and enhance the energy yield under non-uniform irradiation conditions.},
